**Cody** is your friendly neighborhood code review bot. Cody will monitor your
Pull Requests for comments and updates, and make sure that the people you've
called out for review have given their thumbs up on the code before it's merged.

## Features

- [x] Report code review progress with GitHub commit statuses
- [x] Determine list of reviewers from the Pull Request body
- [x] Reviewers give approval by leaving a comment
- [x] Review progress persists when the head commit of the branch changes
- [x] Require a minimum number of reviews
- [x] Rebuild reviews list from PR description on command
- [x] Require 1-n reviewers be from a given a list of reviewers ("super reviewers")
- [ ] Automatically choose reviewers based on PR characteristics

### Anti-features (Not Doing)

* :x: Web interface of any kind
* :x: "Approval groups" (i.e. one of Jane _or_ Mary could :+1:).

## Usage

### Requesting review

To request a review, simply open a new PR and include your desired reviewers in
the form of a [GitHub task list][] in the PR description:

![example-pr](http://cl.ly/e9tF/example-pr.png)

[GitHub task list]: https://github.com/blog/1375%0A-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments

Checking off a box will make sure that reviewer won't need to approve again if
the reviews list is rebuilt later.

### Approving a PR

To approve a PR, you must be a reviewer for that PR and you must leave a comment
with one of the following affirmative phrases on the PR:

* LGTM
* Looks good
* Looks good to me
* :+1:
* :ok:
* :shipit:
* :rocket:
* :100:

You comment should be on its own line with no other text on the same line. The
phrases are case-insensitive. You may include other text in your comment, but
the affirmative phrase should be on its own line.

### Recalculating reviews

If the list of reviewers changes, either the PR author or any of the previously
listed reviewers can recalculate the review list.

To recalculate the review list, leave a comment with the following text:

```
!rebuild-reviews
```

This will instruct the bot to rebuild the review list based on the task list in
the PR description. Reviewers that have already checked their box will be pre-approved
in the new list of reviews.

### Retracting approval

If you previously approved a PR but want to retract your approval, you can do
the following:

1. Uncheck your check box in the task list in the PR description
2. Issue the `!rebuild-reviews` command

Cody will rebuild the reviews list from the task list, and count you as
unapproved because your check box is not checked.

### Controlling what Pull Requests require reviews

#### Using a branch filter

Cody can filter incoming Pull Requests via a branch filter and a filter policy.

The filter is simply a list of branch names. The policy controls whether the
filter behaves like a whitelist (only require reviews on Pull Requests that
target the branches in this list), or blacklist (require reviews on all Pull
Requests except those that target branches in this list).

### Using "super reviewers"

Cody has the concept of "super reviewers". These are a list of reviewers that
you want to ensure sign off on every PR that gets merged.

Cody allows you to configure your list of super reviewers, and also configure
how many super reviewer approvals you want to require for each PR.

PRs that do not include enough super reviewers in the review list will be marked
with the failed status until the reviews are rebuilt and enough super reviewers
are added.

## Setup

To use Cody in your own team, you should deploy your own instance of the app to
some server you control. My team uses Cody with Heroku.

### Heroku Deployment

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

If you use Heroku, you can use the above button to quickly deploy the app to
your Heroku account.

See the **Configuration** section below for information on how to setup Cody.

### DIY

* Ruby 2.2.4
* Postgres
* Redis

### Configuration

At the moment configuration is handled through the Rails console using the
`Setting` model. I may change this in the future if configuration becomes more
complex.

Consult the table below for a list of relevant settings and their function:

Key | Description | Example
----|-------------|--------
`minimum_reviewers_required` | *Fixnum*. The minimum number of reviewers required on every Pull Request. | `Setting.assign "minimum_reviewers_required", 2`
`super_reviewers` | *Array*. The list of GitHub users that are super reviewers. | `Setting.assign "super_reviewers", ["aergonaut", "BrentW"]`
`minimum_super_reviewers` | *Fixnum*. The minimum number of super reviewers required on every Pull Request. | `Setting.assign "minimum_super_reviewers", 1`
`branch_filter` | *Array*. A list of branches to filter incoming Pull Requests by merge base. | `Setting.assign "branch_filter", ["experimental"]`
`branch_filter_policy` | *Symbol*. Either `:blacklist` or `:whitelist`. Controls the behavior of the branch filter. | `Setting.assign "branch_filter_policy", :blacklist`
`status_target_url` | *String*. The URL to link to in the GitHub commit status. | `Setting.assign "status_target_url", "https://yourteam.com/wiki/code-review-policies"`

To set these configuration values, use the Rails console.

### Webhooks

Cody works by receiving GitHub webhooks triggered by events in your repository.

Configure the following webhooks in the repositories you want to use with Cody:

#### Pull Request

#### Issue comment
